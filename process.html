          As a curious, intense learner I design with purpose by creating a development framework. I am able to rapidly prototype and iterate in order to respond uniquely to each individual problem found in the testing of assumptions and hypothesis. My technical and soft skills nurture a series of process loops that ensure quality solutions.
        </p>

          The way I approach a brief varies as projects differ. I begin by using my academic background to research and discover the topics related to what is being asked from me. This is a tricky but very important part of the process given that on the one hand is my interpretation of the brief and on the other is what it's stated is wanted – I try to be cognizant of both as the elements evolve. I proceed to do thorough listening and attempt to identify some hidden gems of what is needed or wanted by my clients but not necessarily being clearly expressed. This process continues all the way to completion given that continuous new insights arise throughout the project and needs to be accounted for. Flexibility and an open mind is of the essence.

          I proceed at this stage, I proceed by defining and synthesizing all my findings, also a dynamic in constant flow within the ever changing section of the process is continuous research, informing the decisions being made. The beginning of the ideation and development phase starts ensuing a headlong process. In this phase I begin to test assumptions and hypothesis, eliminate biases where possible and go through a rapid process of prototyping and iterations to ensure that the work I’m producing remains of value toward the objective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, there is a delivering and implementation phase which remains a series of final iterations which always develop through the testing and measuring of assumptions and hypothesis. The work continues to change at a slower rate than before based on the new information and learnings. Whether a project ever ends is, in my view, always debatable. There are deadlines, yet I strongly believe that through user feedback work can always be improved.
